            having overnight stays. However, due to lack of a clear content and media strategy and knowledge regarding the Chinese market and Chinese 
            audiences, CNTB is struggling to reach them via social media platforms.<br><br>
            As a result, an external, internal analysis and organisation strategy were analysed to outline the content and media function to find out the 
            gaps between the media function, organisational strategy and target audience. Second, a persona analysis was conducted among the target audience 
            to gather more in depth information about the persona. Then a content creation and a distribution plan was provided to promote CNTB’s content and 
            reach the audience</li>

<p class="p_content" style="text-align: left;">The original goal is to stimulate the number of Chinese people to pay a visit to Croatia but after 
having a fully understanding of CNTB’s organisational strategy and situation; the goal was redefined to <mark class="mark"> “raise awareness of Croatia as a tourism 
destination among young Chinese people with content and media strategy”.</mark> Additionally, before reaching the goal, there were serval problems needed 
to be solved.<br><br>

<b style="color: black;">The problems are below:</b><br>
<b style="color: black;">1. Lacking precise knowledge about the Chinese audience,</b> CNTB is unable to distribute the correct content to reach their target audience<br>

<b style="color: black;">2. Low brand awareness among young Chinese people,</b> many Chinese audiences have no clue where Croatia is<br>

<b style="color: black;">3. No specific content and media strategy,</b> CNTB has not developed a structure to explain and communicate with their audiences</p>

<p class="p_content">To solve the first problem, a research-based description of CNTB’s customer persona and a customer journey map through the stages 
of the awareness and consideration process were created. Via that, the first problem was answered.<br><br> 

CNTB’s focus on attract individual travellers’ attention; this group includes office workers and students, they are good at English and finding out the 
travel information via the internet. Most of them using the Internet to search information, and it is easily to approach than via social networking.

<p class="p_content">To raise brand awareness among Zihan and develop a strategy to communicate with her, an authentic and personalised content framework 
were created and utilized to helps CNTB catch up Zihan’s attention. According to Zihan, she likes using articles and videos from micro-influencers to find 
information related to travel. Owing to that, CNTB will cooperate with micro-influencers to create content in order to enhance the Zihan’s awareness.<br><br>

Zihan also makes use of Xiaohongshu, Weibo and online-travel platforms to find information related to travel. Those information offers inspirations for her 
being aware of Croatian tourism and further searches information related to Croatia travel. Then, long-reads will continuously give an online in-depth 
tourism experience for her.<br><br>
                                        
Finally, a distribution plan followed the <span style="color: cadetblue; font-size: 0.8rem;">*SOSTAC</span> was also utilised to plan the promotion and delivery of the content. Through those methods the goal will be 
completed. To be specific, several official social media accounts will be created for CNTB to post content frequently on Xiaohongshu and Weibo to have connection 
and communication with Zihan. The content will pay attention to Zihan's preferred topics (in relation to the content of the Long-Read) to continuously inspire 
Zihan's interests and engagement to encourage Zihan visited Croatia.</p>

<p class="p_content">Due to geographic range limits, it is hard to reach mainland Chinese people from first-tier cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen) via 
social media. The researcher has intended to connect people and friends who have families, friends from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen to send out the questionnaire 
and had interviewed with them, but the researcher could only reach the Chinese people from Hong Kong, Macao, Changsha, Shenyang, Harbin, Quanzhou, Xiamen and so on. Consumers 
from different regions and cities have vastly different income levels, behaviours, and trends. If the researcher conducted research on young Chinese people who live in 
first-tier cities, the outcome of persona section and content treatment might be different. Since people from first-tier cities, the disposable income are higher than other 
second-tier and third-tier cities. They might prefer flocking to Outlet Malls Abroad rather than go to museums or historical sites. </p>

After several meetings and interviews with the users, the problems were defined more specific and detailed, here are the problems:<br><br> 

1. NHIA did not provide completed new employee orientation for the annotators and most of them do not have background knowledge of health 
care; they constantly felt confused on the task, but there was no one can guide them, so they had to take the task longer than PM expected.<br><br>

2. PMs always felt confusion or forgot about the tasks were assigned to who and needed accurate time tracking that alerts when tasks go over
time to prevent bottlenecks.<br><br></p>  

<div class="big_title">Persona </div>

The users were divided into "Project Producer, Annotator”, "Project Manager”, and “Supervisors”; those three kind of personas to look at 
their usage behaviours in making medical projects, annotating medical documents, assess medical documents to evaluating their skills, 
concerns, goals, and technology in relation to develop important insights about features and functionality in this software.</p>

<p class="p_content">Having the interviews with users, the result revealed that there are knowledge gap, intention-behaviour gap (intention 
to use and actual usage behaviour) between three kinds of users that leaded to main problems: the low quality of health documents. To knock 
down those gaps, I designed the wireframes and flowchart based on personas’ needs and pain-points to design a management process which help
 the PMs assign tasks to the right people, and a notification to alert that the tasks might go over time. For the annotators, a fully guideline 
 was designed to explain medical vocabulary to help them understand what they are doing now and what to do in next step.</p>

<p class="p_content">This software aims to help the users to mange the annotation project and make annotation process quickly. Owing to that, 
it is critical to design the UI as simple as we can to avoid the UI complexity for the users; the users will feel nervous and user churn is 
going to be high. The UI style pays attention on designing a simple UI. Additionally, there are many layout pages in Anota; it is necessary to 
build a design system as a collection of repeatable, reusable components and guidelines that explains how to use each of those components. By 
doing so, it is not only speeding up the design process, eliminating inconsistency in design, and minimising design entropy to the development 
team, but also building a better user experience and interface for the users.</p>

而之所以會使用房子來呈現網站是基於產品三層策略的概念(第一層競爭對手有的功能，你都要有，中間為核心功能和體驗，產品的價值、和別的產品有什麼不一樣?、最後一層是情感面(像是使用起來非常有品味、品牌力)。<br><br>
所以一開始的房間非常之簡陋，而隨著時間和經驗的增加，產品才能逐漸達到下一個階段，而在作品放置的概念是一開始的一頁式網頁，這些網頁通常不太會有太複雜的UX考量(但也是需要思考SEO和內容)，第二層的作品開始針對使用者的痛點來提供解決方法，最後的除了著重於使用者的研究外，也搭配數據和訪談經驗來解決問題，當然還有公司的品牌呈現也是非常重要的。</div>

<p class="p_content">First, I focused on the style of Taiwanese Independent music, then finding out the sweet spot between the brand concept of Eslite and the 
style of Taiwanese Independent music and persona’s needs, pain-points to design the landing page. Besides, the persona mentions that she would like to see more 
product descriptions and relevant content. Based on those feedbacks, online music players and slider shows were added to the landing page to attract persona’s 
attention. Furthermore, to convince the visitors to take an action on a landing page, it is also critical to show up a well-structured and clean visual hierarchy 
to guide the readers’ eyes around the content in an intentional way. </p>

<p class="p_content">Concerning readability and to match the elegant style of Taiwanese Independent music, an old-style serif typeface “Garamond” was applied. 
“Garamond” has survived the centuries because of its remarkable readability and its elegantly rounded serifs and its diagonally emphasised strokes.</p>

<p class="p_content">To make the users feel peaceful, quiet, then connecting to Taiwanese Independent music, color pastel orange was chosen. Color pastel orange 
reminds people of calm. When seeing the landing page, the visitors will see a fine view of elegant music style.</p>

<p class="p_content" style="padding: 0 20px 20px 20px;">Due to limited time, there was no time to take the experience by using AB testing and eye tracking to increase web usability. By doing so to understanding 
the users’ online behaviors and viewing patterns of websites to performing tests on the data which Eslite collected from the users is reliable or not to meet the business objectives. Besides, most of the albums 
were the latest release, and that is not enough time to collect the reviews and ratings from the users to increase the purchasing power of the users.</p>

                    頁面，在此，我想跟你分享我的興趣和個人特質，讓你更認識我一點。<br><br>
                    <p>我是個渴求知識的人。透過閱讀專欄報導和收聽知識型的Podcast節目，我能更容易了解事件的脈絡、
                    利益關係人的想法和觀點。而我也會主動搜尋相關事件人事物的背景和歷 史脈絡，幫助我更全面的看
                    待每一件事。<br><br>
                    在家當個廢青很不錯。但我更喜歡上健身房重訓、出外騎腳踏車、爬山、攀岩和嘗試不同的極限運動，
                    運動不但幫助我放鬆，也培養我堅強的意志力!每次在工作上遇到挫折時我都會鼓勵自己，之前都經歷
                    許多挑戰了，還怕這小事!!<br><br>
                    同時我也積極參與UI/UX相關的課程、研討會等。並且研讀工作相關的書籍。當聽到別人分享 自身
                    經驗時，我都感到很開心，因為這幫助我用不同人的角度和思維去思考，在工作中，很多時候需要的是
                    同理心，再傾聽和瞭解對方的想法後，才能進一步去思考對方的需求和問題，並獲得信任，然後提出有
                    價值的反饋和建議。<br><br>
                    朋友都說我是個善於傾聽、安慰和引導別人且內心溫柔善良的人。當然我不完美，很常有冒牌者症候群，
                    有時也會膽怯和拖延，所以我都會給自己設定時間和目標，若是結果不如預期中美好，我會詢問朋友、找
                    尋資料和思考如何做得更好，因為人生沒有標準答案，唯有發展出自己的策略與對應方案。然後不斷的迭代與測試。</p></div>
